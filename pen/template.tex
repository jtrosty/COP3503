%  Make this into a pdf document as follows:
%
%
% The edit the Report.tex file appropriately to include only those elements that
% make sense for the assignment you're reporting on.
%
% You can use a tool like TeXShop or Texmaker or some other graphical tool
% to convert Report.text into a pdf file.
%
% If you are making this with command line tools, you'd run the following command:
%
%     latex Report.tex
%
% That will generate a dvi (device independent) document file called Report.dvi
% The pages reported in the table of contents won't be correct, since latex only
% processes one pass over the document. To adjust the page numbers in the contents,
% run latex again:
%
%    latex Report.tex
%
% Then run
%
%   dvipdf Report.dvi
%
% to generate Report.pdf
%
% You can view this file to check it out by running
%
% xdg-open Report.pdf
%
% That's it.

	\section{Executive Summary}
	
	Here's how to include a picture:
	
	\includegraphics[width=4in]{foo.png}
	
	This is the executive summary.
	It should should definitely be included in your final report but can be omitted in interim reports.
	
	
	\subsection{Project Overview}
	
	\subsection{Goals}
	
	\subsection{Risk Ranking/Profile}
	
	\subsection{Summary of Findings}
	
	\subsection{Recommendation Summary}
	
	
	\section{Technical Report}
	
	\subsection{Introduction}
	Feel free to include an introduction if it suits your communication style.
	You may omit it if you prefer to do so.
	
	% Include one of these headings for each finding.
	
	\subsection{Finding: \emph{Descriptive Name}}
	
	\subsubsection{Severity Rating}
	Here you identify the severity (using the CVSS base score metrics)
	and point out the potential outcome of exploitation of this
	vulnerability.
	
	Include the CVSS base score designation to document your
	severity rating. Example: \\
	
	\textbackslash cvss(A,H,L,N,U,H,L,N,5.4)\\
	\cvss(A,H,L,N,U,H,L,N,5.4)
	
	\subsubsection{Vulnerability Description}
	Here you provide a brief description of the nature of the vulnerability.
	
	\subsubsection{Confirmation method}
	This section contains the information necessary to verify that the
	vulnerability still exists. Note that the inability to confirm
	that the vulnerability does not exist using this method does not
	guarantee that the vulnerability has been addressed or mitigated.
	
	The best confirmation method sections contain a few commands
	to execute. The vulnerability is confirmed by comparing
	the result to the expected result on a vulnerable host/network.
	
	\subsubsection{Mitigation or Resolution Strategy}
	This is where you describe how to address the problem.
	Can it be completely solved or can you, at least, reduce the
	likelihood that the vulnerability can be exploited?
	
	
	
	
	\section{Attack Narrative}
	This section is included only in interim reports, not the final report.
	
	
	You should provide enough information for a knowledgeable
	penetration tester to reproduce your results.
	
	If active intelligence was gathered, you provide enough details of the
	methods employed so that a knowledgeable penetration tester could
	gather the same information.
	
	If a vulnerability was exploited, you provide enough details of your
	activities so that a knowledgeable penetration tester could reproduce
	your results under the ame circumstances.
	
	\subsection{MITRE ATT{\&}CK Framework TTPs}
	
	In this subsection of the Attack Narrative, you provide the MITRE ATT{\&}CK Framework TTPs
	that were employed in the activity.
	Example: \\
	
	\indent\textbackslash ttp(TA0043, Reconnaissance, T1593, Search Open Websites/Domains, .002, Search Engine) \\
	
	\ttp(TA0043, Reconnaissance, T1593, Search Open Websites/Domains, .002, Search Engine)
	
	\indent\textbackslash ttp(TA0002, Execution, T1053, Scheduled Task/Job, .003, Cron) \\
	
	\ttp(TA0002, Execution, T1053, Scheduled Task/Job, .003, Cron)
