%  Make this into a pdf document as follows:
%
%
% The edit the Report.tex file appropriately to include only those elements that
% make sense for the assignment you're reporting on.
%
% You can use a tool like TeXShop or Texmaker or some other graphical tool
% to convert Report.text into a pdf fi le.
%
% If you are making this with command line tools, you'd run the following command:
%
%     latex Report.tex
%
% That will generate a dvi (device independent) document file called Report.dvi
% The pages reported in the table of contents won't be correct, since latex only
% processes one pass over the document. To adjust the page numbers in the contents,
% run latex again:
%
%    latex Report.tex
%
% Then run
%
%   dvipdf Report.dvi
%
% to generate Report.pdf
%
% You can view this file to check it out by running
%
% xdg-open Report.pdf
%
% That's it.

	\subsection{Summary of Findings}
	\indent The hashed passwords harvested in the last report were put through a system to crack the current passwords.  1 password was cracked. 
	
	\subsection{Finding: \emph{Weak Password Requirements CWE-521}}
	
	\subsubsection{Severity Rating}
	\indent The severity is 8.1 This is a high risk exploit that opens network access to an attacker. 
	
	\textbackslash cvss(N,H,N,N,U,H,H,H,8.1)\\
	\cvss(N,H,N,N,U,H,H,H,8.1) \\
	
	\subsubsection{Vulnerability Description}
	\indent The vulnerability make it easier for attackers to use easily available methods to crack passwords. 
	
	\subsubsection{Confirmation method}
	To confirm the exploit use: \\
	\indent 1. Follow instructions ot get \textbf{mimikatz} on windows system.\\
	\indent 2. Use a admin account to run \textbf{mimikatz}.\\
	\indent 3. Once running, escalate privileges with the commands \\ \textbf{PRIVILEGE::Debug0} and \textbf{TOKEN::Elevate}.
	\indent 4. Run the commands \textbf{SEKURLSA::LogonPasswords} and  \textbf{LSADUMP::SAM}.\\
	\indent 5. Use the user accounts and hashes are dumped and crack them with \textbf{John The Ripper} software meant for cracking hashed passwords.  \\
	\indent 6. Use the file \textbf{rockyou.txt} that contains common passwors and one password will be cracked. The password that is cracked is owned by the user \textbf{d.darkblood}. The password used by the individual starts with the letter \textbf{D} and ends with the number \textbf{9}.  \\
	
	\subsubsection{Mitigation or Resolution Strategy}
	\indent \indent 1. Implement a minimum password requirement that requires passwords to be 12 characters with at least 1 uppercase letter, lowercase letter, number, and symbol.  \\
	\indent 2. Password does not include word that can be found in dictionary or the name of a person, product or organization.  \\
	
	\section{Attack Narrative}
	
	\indent The hashed password data collected on report Ex090 was used.  With the \textbf{John The Ripper} software I cracked at least 1 password. Below is evidence of the cracking.  I have whited out the password. The password starts with \textbf{D} and ends with \textbf{9}.  \\
