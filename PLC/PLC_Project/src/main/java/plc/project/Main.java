/**
 * Place this file in your plc.project directory and
 * select the green arrow next to Main to run the program.
 *
 * Your source to be evaluated is entered at the prompt.
 * You can modify the solution to read source from a file.
 * You can also modify this solution to work with our Analyzer and Generator.
 * Note, you will either interpret or analyze+generate, but not both simultaneously,
 * (due to how we have designed our project implementation).
 *
 * Sample source:

 DEF main() DO print(1 + 2); END
 //

 * The inline comment with no information (no actual comment) closes the source entry.
 * This allows you to enter as many or as few lines as you would like to evaluate.
 *
 * This source example prints 3.
 *
 * In this solution, the AST is built from the source (parseSource),
 * Therefore, you must provide valid source from the root of the grammar.
 * You can modify the solution to start from other nodes and test more specific expressions,
 * such as by starting at statement (parseStatement) or expression (parseExpression) levels.
