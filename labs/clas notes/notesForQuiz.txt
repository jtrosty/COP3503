Why?

Class vs Struct can be used interchangably 
The only difference is that 'struct' is set to public by default. 

Why do we write classes?
-Allows separate parts of a program. 
-Don't forget a semicolon at the end of a class. 
What is encapsulation, and why do we do it?
-Groups data and functionality together. 

Construction

What does a constructor look like? (i.e. how would you write one?)
- 
What is a default constructor?
-Function that is called when your object is created. 
-No return type 

Do you need a default constructor?
- No you get 1 by default unless yoou start makign a constructor.  If you do not make any constructiosn a default contsructor is provided for you in not decalred. 
-The implicitly decalred constructor does nothign at all. 
What is an implicitly declared constructor?
How many constructors can an object have?
-As many as you want. 
-You can assign default value also for your default contructor. Once you start assigning a default value you have to continue doing it.  Ex:
Void foo (int x =5, int y =2, int z= 0); // Default values
Void Foo (int x, int y = 2, int z = 0); // y and z ahve default, user needs to put x.
Void Foo (int x = 5, int y, int z = 0); // NO GOOD, either Y needs default value or x needs to remove its' default value. 



Other class functions

What is the purpose of an accessor function?
-allows you to access private variables. 
-get functions. Get yous a copy of a private variable. 
What is the purpose of a mutator function?
-'set' functions, change somethign about the class, or they 'do' something to the class. EX: increasing the strength of the pokemond last semester. 
How do we use/write these things?
Example
calss Foo
{
public:
	Foo();
	Foo(int x);
	Foo(int x, float y, string z);
};

int main() 
{
	Foo 0bject;
	Foo otherObject(16);
	Foo anotherFoo(5, -12, "Dinosaur");

	return 0;
}

Behaviors
-set multiple values, call multiple functions. 

What is an invoking object?
What is the "this" keyword?
	- 'this' represetns teh invoking object - the object that called the function. 
What are the different levels of accessibility for class members?
What accessibility does a class have by default? What about a struct?
Class vs Struct can be used interchangably 
The only difference is that 'struct' is set to public by default. 
How are classes broken down in separate files? (i.e. what parts of a class go in which files?)
-Header - initial defination of the class itself 
	- has private variables adn function prototypes.
	- Serves as a "table of contents" almost. 
	- Source file - where teh class functions are defined.

emaple class
clase Person
{
private:
	string name_;
	int age_;
	
public:
	int money_;
	
}; <---- DON'T FORGET THIS!


// EXAMPLE OF WRITING CLASSES

// MyClass.h - prototype
class MyClass 
{
	int foo;
	int severalFoos[3];
	float otherVaule;

public:
	MyClass(int, float);
	int GetFoo();
};

// MyClass.cpp - definitions. 
#include "MyClass.h"
MyClass::MyClass(int f, float ov)
{
	// "this->" allows access to the object which invoked this function (similar to Java)
	this->foo = f;
	
	// Don't HAVE TO use 'this'
	otherValue = ov;
}

int MyClass::GetFoo()
{
	return foo;
}
